## Description

This boilerplate is a next-generation web application that combines the power of Next.js 13, Prisma, PlanetScale, and Typescript to deliver a fast, secure, and scalable user experience. With this app, you can easily build dynamic and interactive web pages and take advantage of the latest web technologies to stay ahead of the curve. Features

    Next.js 13: Our app is built on the latest version of Next.js, which provides a modern and intuitive development experience and powerful tools for server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, and optimized performance.

    Prisma: We use Prisma as our data access layer to manage our database and provide a type-safe and intuitive API for working with our data.

    PlanetScale: Our app is powered by PlanetScale, a cloud-native database-as-a-service that provides a scalable, highly available, and globally distributed data platform for our app.

    Typescript: We use Typescript to provide a type-safe and structured development experience, making it easier to catch bugs and write more maintainable code.
